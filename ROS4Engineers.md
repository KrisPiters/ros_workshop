# Workshop "ROS for Engineers"

Author (NL): Eric Dortmans (e.dortmans@fontys.nl)

Translation: Kris Piters (k.piters@fontys.nl)

## Learning goals

1. Know and understand basic concepts of ROS
2. Being able to deal with various ROS tools in a practical way
3. Being able to build an application yourself with existing ROS nodes
4. Being able to Model, visualize and simulate robots
5. Being able to make a mobile robot platform navigate autonomously
6. Being able to plan a trajectory for a robot arm

To achieve these learning objectives, a number of sessions are required.

## Foreknowledge

Required prior knowledge:

- Some skills in dealing with Linux (especially Ubuntu), both with the mouse and via commands in a terminal window
- Some knowledge of sensors (camera, laser scanner, etc.), and actuators (motors etc.)
- Some knowledge of kinematics
- Some knowledge of interfaces (USB, RS232, Ethernet / EtherCat)

Programming experience is not necessary, but useful.

## Necessities

You have to bring your own laptop with Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS Kinetic installed.

Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 can be downloaded [here](http://www.ubuntu.com/download).

A guide for installing ROS Kinetic (Desktop - full install) in Ubuntu can be found [here](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu).

## Linux command skill

In order to work with ROS, you have to have some skills in dealing with Linux commands.
